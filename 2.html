    <p>Shaping the future of telecommunication
Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies to the public at large.

The convergence of Web and mobile industries is now fully in march, driven by the convergence of the underlying technologies to IP-based systems.

As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to service providers to extend their existing services to new users and devices, and to propose new and innovative services to their subscribers.

In developed markets, voice and messaging revenues are set on a path of decline; service providers have already started to take their first steps toward their digital pivot, where they can provide additional services to their subscribers at a lower cost. The Web platform is the most open platform on which these new digital services can be built, and its recent extension to real-time communication, payments and Internet-of-Things mark it as a critical component of any digital strategy for service providers.

In developing markets, mobile networks are the primary and often unique Internet connectivity available to the vast majority of users, bringing vast opportunities for operators to serve as enablers of a new episode in the IT boom.</p>
